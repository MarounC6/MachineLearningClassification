Files

    train.csv - the training set
    test.csv - the test set (which does not contain any reference data for the evolution of the prices in British Columbia)
    sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format (values for the predicted evolution are random, this file is just an illustration of what format you should use when uploading!)

Columns

    id - Unique identifier used by Kaggle
    date - Date at which the measurement was made, between the 15th of May 2015 and the 13th of December 2017 (normalized between 0 and 1)
    hour - Hour of measurement as a half hour period of time over 24 hours (values originally between 0 and 47, here normalized between 0 and 1)
    bc_price - Electricity price in British Columbia (normalized between 0 and 1)
    bc_demand - Electricity demand in British Columbia (normalized between 0 and 1)

    transfer - Electricity transfer scheduled between British Columbia and Alberta (normalized between 0 and 1)
    bc_price_evo - Is the price in British Columbia going UP or DOWN compared to the last 24 hours? This is the target variable (i.e., it is only given during training)



Description
Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated using the Accuracy Score between the predicted state of electricity price and the actual values (i.e., the percentage of correct answers).
Submission File

For each id in the test set, you must predict whether the price is going UP or DOWN for the bc_price_evo variable. The file should contain a header and have the following format:
